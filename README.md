# web_fiction_tracker

This is a tracker for web fictions. Right now, it works with stories from fanfiction.net, only.

What it can do:
* Import my bookmarks (where it imports from is defined in code, I might fix that);
* Display a list of the fics I read, along with the last chapter I read, the link for the next chapter (if there is one), and the number of the last chapter available;
* Add new fics to the list;
* Check for updates for the fics in the list;
* Hide fics if you don't wanna see them.

What it currently can't do:
* Update the last chapter read for a certain fic;
* Delete a fic.

I want to track the web fictions I read, and I want to also learn Python for web. This was a way of doing it, so here I am.
